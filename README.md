<h1>Highly Available and Secure Serverless Web Application on AWS</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The project focuses on creating a contemporary web application architecture using AWS cloud services. The project emphasizes the importance of achieving high availability, scalability, and security while keeping operational overhead to a minimum.

<br />Key aspects include:

- Serverless Architecture: the application architecture was designed with serverless computing services like AWS Lambda, which eliminates the hassle of server management and allows for seamless infrastructure scaling based on demand.
- High Availability: Using redundant components and distributed systems across multiple availability zones within the AWS infrastructure, the architecture maximizes availability.
- Scalability: The application is designed to effortlessly handle fluctuating levels of user traffic while maintaining optimal performance. This is made possible by leveraging the flexibility of serverless services and the ability to automatically scale as needed.
- Security: Security is always a top priority. To achieve this, AWS Cognito handles user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can acces the system. AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is used to encrypt data, providing an extra layer of protection. In addition, AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) to safeguard against common web exploits. These measures work together to ensure system security and protect users' data.
- Data Management: Amazon DynamoDB is used to efficiently manage both structured and unstructured data for NoSQL database requirements. Additionally, Amazon S3 is utilized for storing user-uploaded files and static assets.
- Monitoring and Logging: The architecture has strong monitoring and logging solutions using AWS CloudWatch for real-time monitoring and AWS CloudTrail for auditing API calls.

This project aims to showcase the implementation of best practices in building modern web applications on AWS, providing a foundation for highly available, scalable, and secure cloud-native applications. This project is designed to demonstrate how to build modern web applications on AWS using best practices. It serves as a basis for creating cloud-native applications that are highly available, scalable, and secure.

<h3>Services:</h3>

Frontend:
- Hosted on Amazon S3 for static web hosting.
- Utilize Amazon CloudFront as a content delivery network (CDN).

Backend API:
- AWS Lambda will provide serverless compute for running application code in response to events.
- Amazon API for creating and managing APIs that trigger Lambda functions.
- AWS Cognito for user authentication and authorization.
- AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for managing encryption keys for data at rest and in transit.

Data Storage:
- Amazon DynamoDB will serve as NoSQL database service for storing and retrieving application data with high scalability and performance..
- Amazon S3 for storing user-uploaded files and static assets.

Security:
- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for fine-grained access control.
- AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web exploits.
- AWS CloudTrail for auditing API calls.

Monitoring and Logging:
- Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring Lambda functions, API Gateway, and other AWS services.
- AWS CloudTrail for logging API calls and monitoring AWS resource usage.

<h3>Data Flow:</h3>

1. The user's browser interacts with Amazon CloudFront to ensure faster content delivery.
2. Requests are forwarded to Amazon S3, where the frontend is hosted.
3. Requests are sent to the API Gateway.
4. Users are authenticated using AWS Cognito.
5. The API gateway performs authentication verification. 
6. The API Gateway triggers AWS Lambda functions to process the requests, taking into account the path and HTTP method.
7. Lambda functions interact with Amazon DynamoDB for data storage and retrieval.

Response to API Gateway: The Lambda function returns the response data to API Gateway.<br>
API Gateway Response: API Gateway formats and returns the response to the user's browser.

<h3>Security Best Practices:</h3>

- IAM Roles: ensure that Lambda functions have the appropriate level of access by utilizing IAM roles. They should only access the resources necessary for their tasks.
- Cognito for Authentication: was utilized to easily manage user access and enforce strong password policies.
- WAF for Protection: to protect against common web exploits such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting.
- S3 Bucket Policies: to secure S3 buckets by setting up access control policies that limit access to only authorized users and applications.
- DynamoDB Encryption: to encrypt data both when it's at rest and when it's in transit.
- CloudTrail and CloudWatch Logging: CloudTrail was enabled to log API calls and CloudWatch for application and resource logs to monitor activity and potential security threats.

<h3>High Availability Considerations:</h3>

- Multi-AZ Deployment: Deploy your Lambda functions and DynamoDB tables across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within a region for redundancy.
- Auto Scaling: Set up Lambda with auto scaling so that it can automatically adjust its resources according to the amount of traffic it receives. This will help ensure that Lambda remains responsive even during periods of high demand.
- API Gateway Throttling and Caching: It's a good idea to add throttling to API Gateway to protect against denial-of-service attacks. Additionally, you might want to think about using caching mechanisms to enhance performance.
- Health Checks: You can use CloudWatch to set up health checks for Lambda functions. This allows you to automatically trigger recovery actions if any failures occur.

<h2>Summary</h2>

This project demonstrates an architecture for a web application that is both highly available and secure. The architecture is built on AWS, utilizing serverless technology. By using serverless technologies such as Lambda and following security best practices, the application can scale automatically, reduce costs, and provide strong protection against unauthorized access. This architecture uses a mix of AWS services, such as DynamoDB for storing data, API Gateway for routing requests, and Cognito for managing users. It is a secure and scalable solution for modern web applications.
